Here every notebook contains a brief description of the exercise, finite element code for finding the solution as well as plots to analyse the results.

- 1. Project flux.ipynb
  - Project the gradient of head (fluxes) to the nodes for ease of plotting. Shows how to use the tools from MesherWrapper.py to easily create a mesh and also plotting the results.

- 2. Sheet pile.ipynb
  - Solution of the Laplacian equation on a simple dam mesh. Also shows how to use the meshing and plotting tools.

- 3. Unconfined dam.ipynb
  - Here we assume that our dam is not fully saturated; we then use a non-linear solver to find the free flow surface.

- 4. 1D Diffusion.ipynb
  - Simple finite difference math for a transient one dimentional problem. Shows how to make animations.

- 5. Injection in a wellbore.ipynb
  - A now more intricate 2D transient problem.

- 6. Boussinesq plate
  - We finally get into elasticity and solve a well known axissymmetric problem.

- 7. Poroelastic sphere.ipynb
  - Things get more intricate with the coupling of porous flow AND elasticity.

- 8. Tunnel excavation.ipynb
  - A similar but more realistic setting than the last exercise.

- Fracture in homogenous medium.ipynb
  - Similar to the tunnel excavation.

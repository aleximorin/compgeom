# CIVIL-423

Finite element python code for the course [Computational geomechanics'](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/computational-geomechanics-CIVIL-423) exercises. 

The code is translated from Matlab code developped by the [Geo-Energy Lab](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/gel/fr/index-fr-html/), based at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, [accessible here](https://github.com/GeoEnergyLab-EPFL/Civil-423-2022/tree/week_9_tag).

Most of the python code relies on a [simple anaconda distribution](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html) (i.e. numpy, scipy, matplotlib) but needs the functions from the [pygmsh library](https://pygmsh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). It can be easily installed with the command

``pip install pygmsh``

You also can install everything needed at once for an empty environment with the command

``pip install -r requirements.txt``
